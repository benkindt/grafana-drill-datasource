## Usage
Currently the plugin requires a proxy server running to communicate with the database.

**Install sqlproxyserver**
 
 * Run `npm install` at the `dist/serverside` folder to install all dependencies
 * Run npm install on the plugin directory
 * Run server side code `dist/serverside/sqlproxyserver.js`
 * Test on your browser `http://myserver:port/?con=mssql://user:name@server/database` you must get a `{"status":"success"}` response

**Add new datasource**
Add a new datasource to Grafana and set the url to:

````
http://myserver:port/con=mssql://user:name@server/database
http://myserver:port/con=drill:server:port
````

Where:

 * **myserver:port** : Is the server where `sqlproxyserver` is running
 * **con**: Specifies the sql connection string

## SQL Databases

### Metrics
It is possible to define two different types: `timeseries` and `table`

### Annotation
Annotation querires must return the following fields:
 
 * **title**: Annotation header
 * **text**:  Annotation description
 * **tags**: Annotation tags
 * **time**: Annotation time

## Notes
### Time
UTC and Localtime. Currently you must specify if time returned by the query is UTC or local. 
The plugin will convert localtime to UTC in order to be correctly renderer.
### Template
You can use `$from` and `$to` to refer to selected time period in your queries like:

````
SELECT field FROM table WHERE datestart >= '$from' AND dateStart <= '$to'
````
